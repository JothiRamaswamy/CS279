# CS 279 TIER 2 - DOODLE

## Collaboration

This assignment was completed by Jothi Ramaswamy and Justin O'Dwyer

## How to launch

The best way to launch this todo list is to pull the current repository from github and open the index.html file directly in your chosen browser, which will also render the CSS/JS files. For me, this means opening something like file:///Users/jothiramaswamy/Documents/cs279/tier2_doodle/index.html directly in Chrome (this will vary depending on the filepath).

## How to use
When you open there is a space at the top of the screen to add your name, and then thereâ€™s a table with some dates/times as the header, with a row below of boxes under each date/time column for the user to click and select their availability. Users can keep clicking each of the boxes to toggle the availability from yes to no to maybe then resetting it back to the box to start over again.

Once you click add, your availability is submitted and gets added to a table of everyone else's availability, which is now displayed in place of the table where you can submit availabilities. Note that you can only successfully submit if you have entered your name and have changed at least one of the availabilities from the original default box. This table has two default users' availabilities just to demonstrate what this interface could look like in the real world with multiple users using it.

## Key features separating this from When2Meet

The most key feature is just the ability to select a box to check off your availability for a certain date/time in Doodle, rather than using When2Meet's dragging feature to select your availability for a date/time. Another cool secondary feature that Doodle uniquely has is the ability to mark an availability as maybe, instead of yes/no, which allows users to mark tentative availabilities. I'm curious to see how this affects how users choose their availabilities.
